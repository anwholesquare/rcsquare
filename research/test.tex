    \hline
    Profile & Description & Relevance in this project \\
    
    \hline
    K3 & Engineering fundamentals required in computer science and engineering & Applied in designing the overall system architecture, database schema, communication between services, and in applying fundamental concepts such as modularity, abstraction and concurrency. \\
    \hline
    K4 & Specialist engineering knowledge in modern AI and data engineering & Needed to select and configure Voyage text and multimodal embedding models, Qdrant vector indexes, LLM reranking strategies and to interpret their strengths and limitations for educational retrieval. \\
    \hline
    K5 & Knowledge that supports engineering design in a practice area & Used to design the end to end retrieval pipeline, including ingestion, indexing, search APIs, ranking and dashboard, while balancing accuracy, latency, storage and maintainability. \\
    \hline
    K6 & Knowledge of engineering practice and technologies & Required for implementing the solution in Python, integrating MySQL, Qdrant, FFmpeg, Whisper and web frameworks, deploying and testing the pipeline on realistic workloads and resource constraints. \\
    \hline
    K8 & Engagement with research literature and current developments & Necessary for reviewing prior work on dense retrieval, lecture video search, multimodal embeddings and RAG style systems, and for positioning the contribution of this thesis relative to existing studies. \\
